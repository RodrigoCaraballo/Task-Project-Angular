# Task Management Web - Angular

#### Full Stack Project - Back-End ([https://github.com/RodrigoCaraballo/Task-Project-NestJS](https://github.com/RodrigoCaraballo/Task-Project-NestJS))

### Purpose of the Web

This web was created with the aim of improving my personal programming skills in Angular and the use of the Tailwind Framework, with the additional goal of using it to develop a functional web to put Full Stack skills into practice. This web is designed to allow users to manage their personal tasks, allowing operations such as creating, editing, changing status, and deleting tasks related to a user. Additionally, it features a small registration and login system.
