# Task Management Web - Angular

#### Full Stack Project - Back-End ([https://github.com/RodrigoCaraballo/Task-Project-NestJS](https://github.com/RodrigoCaraballo/Task-Project-NestJS))

### Purpose of the Web

This web was created with the aim of improving my personal programming skills in Angular and the use of the Tailwind Framework, with the additional goal of using it to develop a functional web to put Full Stack skills into practice. This web is designed to allow users to manage their personal tasks, allowing operations such as creating, editing, changing status, and deleting tasks related to a user. Additionally, it features a small registration and login system.

### How to Use the Application

You can use the Full Stack application at the following link: [https://casual-task-app.netlify.app](https://casual-task-app.netlify.app/)

The web requires the creation of a user in the registration menu. But if you prefer not to register, you can use the following credentials to test the web: Email: [casualuser@mail.com](mailto:casualuser@mail.com) Password: Casual1234?

The application does not require extensive instructions for use since it contains an intuitive interface to test the aforementioned functionalities of creating, editing, deleting, and changing the status of tasks.

_I am open to any suggestions that could improve the application and my personal development, thank you very much._
